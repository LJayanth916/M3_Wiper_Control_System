INTRODUCTION
A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water.
Wipers of this type are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, locomotives, and certain aeroplanes.

After reading various research articles, I realised that safety standards for motor vehicles in inclement weather are required even at low speeds, therefore I began designing a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers.

Rubber blades are affixed to the metal arms and pivot magnets are attached to the other ends.

Finally, our project application aids users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and facilitating safe and healthy travel.
