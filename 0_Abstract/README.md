INTRODUCTION 

A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device which is used to remove rain water, snow, ice from a vehicle's front window.
Every heavy motor vehicles such as cars, heavy trucks , train locomotives and some aircrafts are installed with such wipers .
After reading several research papers , I understood that safety requirements under bad weather conditions is necessary even at low speed also for motor vehicles and therefore I started making wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers.
It consists of rubber blades attached at its metal arms with pivot magnets at its other ends.
Finally this project application helps users in day to day life and prevents accidents and allows safe journey.
