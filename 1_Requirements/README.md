# INTRODUCTION

A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water.Wipers of this type are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, locomotives, and certain aeroplanes.After reading various research articles, I realised that safety standards for motor vehicles in inclement weather are required even at low speeds, therefore I began designing a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers.Rubber blades are affixed to the metal arms and pivot magnets are attached to the other ends.Finally, our project application aids users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and facilitating safe and healthy travel.

## THE STUDY
This application was derived from a variety of sources (including Google and numerous research articles) and then adapted into a functioning model application of wiper control utilising an arm-based microcontroller.

## FINAL GOAL 
- Clear vision in inclement weather. 
- With the latest mechanism, you may avoid mishaps and secure your safety.

### Who 
- Anyone who values road safety and good vision when driving a car.

### What is it? 
- A vehicle's wiper control system.

### When 
- When you realise the necessity of safety management and begin to take responsibility for your own health while driving in inclement weather. 

### Where
 - The user can utilise this in their day-to-day lives to track their safety and produce better results in life while travelling by motor vehicle.

### How 
- After wiping the windsheet of a car, the LED reveals the position of the wiper and returns to its original position.
