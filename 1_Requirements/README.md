INTRODUCTION

A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device which is used to remove rain water, snow, ice from a vehicle's front window.
Every heavy motor vehicles such as cars, heavy trucks , train locomotives and some aircrafts are installed with such wipers .
After reading several research papers , I understood that safety requirements under bad weather conditions is necessary even at low speed also for motor vehicles and therefore I started making wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers.
It consists of rubber blades attached at its metal arms with pivot magnets at its other ends.
Finally this project application helps users in day to day life and prevents accidents and allows safe journey.

## RESEARCH
This application is researched from various sources (like google and many research papers ) and then I have modified into successful working model application of wiper control system using arm based microcontroller. 

## END GOAL
- Clear vision in adverse weather conditions .
- Avoid accidents and ensure safety with latest mechanism.

### Who
-   Everyone who wants safety and clear vision of road in driving using motor vehicles.
### What
-   Wiper Control System for motor vehicles.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you understand the importance of safety management and start to be accountable for your health during driving motor vehicles in unfavourable weather conditions.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their safety and  generate better results in life during travelling via motor vehicles  .
### How
-   LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original position after cleaning windsheet of motor vehicles  .
